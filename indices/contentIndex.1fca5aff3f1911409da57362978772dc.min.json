The request was for us to liberate some ancient armories deep underground. Along the way, we encountered some rust monsters that had armor-dissolve antennae. Eventually we found the armory, with enough supplies inside to start a war. On a pedastal within the armory, we also found [[The Athame]], an icy cursed dagger that knocked Lilan unconcious upon touching it. The also found an alloyed sword that is very old, some armor stands made of wood that behaves like metal, and some rust monster eggs. We had to enlist the aid of the Red Queen to heal Lilan, but in return she took some of our blood and will ask us for a favour.\n^summary\n\n## Recap of last session\n\n\n\n## Log\n\n**\n\n-   Prints of quadrepedic insect, two claws per limb\n    \n-   Antennae dissolves armor\n    \n-   Burrows underground\n    \n-   Chitinous shell \n    \n-   Antenna will work for some time after the insect is dead, until it runs out of magic which is provided by metabolism\n    \n-   Rust formation is instantaneous \n    \n-   Big ones antennae forms into horns, has spikes that can be used to attack\n    \n\n-   Instantly crumbles \n    \n\n-   Eggs don’t need to be heated, the heat generated is natural\n    \n-   Found the armory, enough to fund war/an army\n    \n-   ## On the Athame\n    \n-   A single pedestal seemingly made of glacial ice/glass, glinting with light\n    \n\n-   Sitting on it is a dagger, in similar glacial blue colour; seemingly made of ice\n    \n\n-   Created its own temperature zone\n    \n\n-   Of Fae origin, from the Winter Courts most likely\n    \n-   Thae’Ed left us to dry, didn't want anything to do with it (Aelar tried talking)\n    \n-   It spoke a word to Lilan, Athame\n    \n\n-   Athame: a type/style of ritual daggers; sometimes used for sacrifice or other rituals. Every athame is created differently, always serving a purpose in some form of ritual. This Athame clearly belongs to the Winter Fae, but we do not know the true name.\n    \n\n-   Touching it briefly yields a wisdom save, on success you resist its influence and feel immense cold for a while; on failure you feel nothing but your temperature drops to ice cold and you become ensnared in its effects, a magical cold that seems to still be mended by physical temperature\n    \n\n-   The armor stands were made of peculiar wood. It is extremely lightweight yet does not snap when forced; instead it bends like metal\n    \n-   We found a dark grey iron/steel sword but it casts quite a bit more light like polished or the moon\n    \n\n-   It was stuck inside a hidden alcove, hilt sticking out of the ground\n    \n-   421 years old leather\n    \n-   The metal is wayyyyyyyy older, beyond what I can gauge\n    \n-   Apparently I can age things using my senses, taste being the best\n    \n\n-   After clearing out one of the armouries, we hid a lot of gear and 3 eggs, along with the weird sword, in the hidden alcove inside the walls\n    \n-   We were taken back to the court after clearing out one of the armouries and presenting the eggs to Rusty, he seemed to really liked the eggs\n    \n-   ## Red Queen’s Favour\n    \n-   The Queen questioned what we used, specifically if we used magic or not; Aelar admits that we did and she smiles even harder with teeth glistening\n    \n\n-   The bugs do not invade the armouries, they stick to the caves; “They do not invade the ways of the old”\n    \n-   There is a parasite living in Lilan originated from the Ice Dagger; it is now part of him; it can be removed but with a cost\n    \n-   She offers to help Lilan for a future favour; she says that he will be observed and seen by the Fae but physically he will be fine\n    \n-   She made us cut ourselves with a black glass dagger, which sucked up our blood; she then stabbed through Lilan’s hand that touched that dagger; the blood pours out and it seems to be absorbed by Lilan’s body and skin\n    \n\n\n\n**\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-15T19:02:31.434242724Z","tags":null},"/Session-Notes/202004-Battle-for-the-Second-Armory-2020-April-May":{"title":"","content":"\n## Session Summary\n\nWe were told by the Kobolds to recover another one of their armories.
